# CCalculator
A simple calculator programmed in C. Performs the four basic mathematical operations.

Nothing special about this program. I created it while learning how **scanf** behaves.

Later on, i reinforced the **scanf** procedures by enclosing them in **do..while** loops that keep asking for a valid command if a wrong one is given, and made the UI more "appealing" and explanatory.

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and run "CCalculator.exe"
